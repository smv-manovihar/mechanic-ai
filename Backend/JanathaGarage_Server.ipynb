A leak can cause metal parts to make noise.\n3. **Lifter Noise Check**: If you have a hydraulic lifter system (common in many modern engines), it's possible that the lifters are faulty and causing the ticking sound. You can try replacing the lifter silencers (also known as \"ticking noise eliminators\") or replace the entire lifter assembly.\n4. **Oil Pump Inspection**: If you suspect a problem with the oil pump, check for any unusual noises coming from it.\n\n**Tools Required**:\n\n* Oil level gauge\n* Socket wrench set\n* Torx screwdriver (for accessing valve cover gasket)\n* Multimeter (for checking oil pressure)\n\n**Parts Replacement**: Depending on the diagnosis, potential parts to replace could be:\n\t+ Valve cover gasket or seal\n\t+ Timing chain tensioner or guide\n\t+ Oil pump or its drive assembly\n\n**Safety Tips**:\n\n* Be cautious when working under the hood, as you'll need to access various components that might be hot.\n* Ensure the engine is at normal operating temperature before starting any repairs.\n\nBefore proceeding with further checks or repairs, please confirm if this explanation aligns with your understanding of the issue.\n",

This image is animated at In a diesel engine there are no spark plugs. The fuel is ignited based on compression alone. The compression is higher on a diesel engine, which generates enough heat to cause the combustion. A hybrid vehicle uses an electric motor and battery for assisting propulsion along with the internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine generates electricity to recharge the batteries. Also, the batteries are recharged when braking to a stop. Engine Oil Sample of motor oil The purpose of engine oil is to form a film of lubrication between all moving parts of an internal combustion engine to reduce friction and wear. Choosing the right engine oil for your vehicle and changing the oil during regularly-scheduled maintenance intervals will keep the engine running smoothly over time. The recommended oil type and specification for your vehicle can be found in the owners manual. Another place to find it is on the oil fill cap. It will be based on the ambient temperature where you live. There are two engine oil codes that the owner(cid:1)s manual will specify, an API and an SAE. All oil has an API code which stands for American Petroleum Institute. Its a service rating for the quality, cleanliness, and types of detergents in the oil. The code will always be two letters. The SAE is the viscosity or thickness of the oil. Modern oil is multi-viscosity oil. The SAE may be something to the effect of 5W-30. The first number-letter combo (5W) indicates the viscosity or thickness of the oil when it is cold. The second number is the viscosity at the engine operating temperature. Before they had multi-viscosity oil there was only single-viscosity oil (such as SAE 30), which in cold weather was extremely thick. Trying to pour it into your engine would be like pouring honey, but more importantly it would be hard to pump the oil\n",
            "finally opened. Almost any topic regarding your vehicle(cid:1)s maintenance can be found in the index. Owner(cid:1)s Manual The owner(cid:1)s manual will have a maintenance chart. The chart will include such information as when to change the oil, rotate tires, replace the air filter, inspect fuel cap and lines, change other fluids (transmission fluid, etc.) and other maintenance issues. Your vehicle may have different maintenance requirements at 30,000 miles, 90,000 miles, 150,000 miles and at other intervals as indicated specifically in your owner(cid:1)s manual. Being familiar with the maintenance chart in your owner(cid:1)s manual can help you save money when taking your car to the mechanic for maintenance checks. Sometimes the repair shop will suggest additional services that aren(cid:1)t necessary. If you don(cid:1)t have the owner(cid:1)s manual for your car then you may be able to find one online by using Google or another search engine. Search the website for the make of the vehicle. You could also try your local library. Vehicle Fluids: Vehicle fluids include brake fluid, engine oil, coolant, power steering fluid, windshield washer fluid, transmission fluid and battery fluid. Fluid level information and the location of each fluid reservoir can be found in the owner(cid:1)s manual for your particular vehicle. (Any images in this chapter are illustrative of one example and your vehicle may look different). Brake Fluid: On most vehicles the reservoir for brake fluid is clear. You can check the fluid without removing the cap. There will be a marking on the reservoir that indicates minimum and maximum level. You(cid:1)ll want to make sure that the level is between those two marks. This fluid should never need to be topped off during maintenance. Low fluid is an indication of a problem. If the fluid is low then you may want to bring it to a mechanic, depending on your own skill level. Most vehicles have a dashboard light that illuminates when the brake fluid is low.

Engine oil should be checked each time the vehicle is refueled (i.e. each time you go to the gas station). Most engines, but not all, have a dipstick to indicate the oil level. Typically the handle is yellow. Follow these steps to check the oil: Turn the engine off. Remove the dipstick. Wipe off the end of the dipstick with a rag or paper towel. Put the dipstick back in. Take it out to look at the level at the tip The stick will have marks on it. The (cid:2)add(cid:3) mark typically indicates one quart low.

If you(cid:1)ve just been driving then don(cid:1)t open it. After you think the engine has cooled then you can lightly touch the radiator cap to test it. If it(cid:1)s still hot, then don(cid:1)t open it. Opening the radiator cap while the engine is still hot can shoot a six-foot geyser into the air and burn any skin it contacts. The best time to check the coolant is in the morning before the car is driven. Coolant. Notice the green color; coolant can actually be any color (pink, orange, transparent, red, etc.) A low coolant level indicates a possible leak which should be investigated. A very small amount of evaporation of coolant can occur over time. As a rule, if you need more than one quart of coolant, that indicates a problem. If the coolant is low then it needs to be replenished with the proper type of coolant and mixture. Consult the owner(cid:1)s manual for the proper type of coolant. The proper mixture is a 50/50 ratio of coolant and distilled water. It is important to use distilled water because the impurities in\n"

When chocks are included with the tire changing kit, then they should be used. However, they are not present with every vehicle. Cases where they(cid:1)re not present may include vehicles with a rear parking brake and front wheel drive. When changing a rear wheel in these vehicles the front wheel drive keeps the vehicle stable, and when changing a front wheel in these vehicles the rear parking brake keeps the vehicle stable.

Probably the most important number for the common person to recognize is the recommended tire pressure on the vehicle manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications on the driver(cid:1)s door jamb sticker. (The tire manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications on the tire itself include the maximum pressure that the tire can have, yet the maximum pressure isn(cid:1)t necessarily the best pressure for the vehicle). How to Check the Tire Pressure In order to check tire pressure you(cid:1)ll need a tire pressure gauge. Gauges can be purchased at auto parts stores and service stations (sometimes a little as $1, but could be $3-$7). They(cid:1)re usually about the size of a large pen, but can come in other forms. Sometimes a gauge is included with the air hose of the air dispensing stand at the gas station. Pen-sized tire pressure gauge Air dispensing hose at a gas station with built-in pressure gauge Round tire pressure gauge and hose Follow these steps to check and correct the tire pressure: Remove the valve cap of each tire Align the gauge up to the valve Press the gauge onto the valve with firm direct pressure and then release. You(cid:1)ll see the measuring stick get pushed out of the other side of the gauge (on a pen gauge). Fill the tire with air, recheck the pressure, then repeat as needed until the desired pressure is obtained. Replace the valve cap Tire pressure is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch) or KPA (Kilopascals) which are simply units of measurement for pressure. (Pressure is a force distributed over surface area) Checking the tire pressure Wheel Alignment Tires can wear rapidly if they are not aligned properly, or the vehicle can pull to one side while driving.

The wear bar indicates safe tread depth. It is usually about 1/16 of an inch measured from the valley of the tread, but not as high as the tread itself when the tire is new. As the tread wears down, the wear bar becomes more visible. When the tread is even with the wear bar the tires should be changed. Tires should be rotated with each oil change and kept in alignment to ensure even tread wear. Tire with arrows pointing to the wear bars between the treads. How to Change a Tire Knowing how to change a tire is mostly helpful in case you get a flat while driving on the road. Every other time your tires get removed, rotated and/or replaced it will be by a tire technician. Every vehicle has instructions for using the jack and other tools as necessary to change the tire. Some of the details can vary by make and model, such as the storage location for the jack and spare tire. Consult the owner(cid:1)s manual of the vehicle.

If there is, then it can be checked the same way as the brake fluid described above. If the power steering fluid is not in a clear reservoir then it will have a dipstick. Refer to the owner(cid:1)s manual for the location of the reservoir and the type of fluid that should be used. Low power steering fluid is an indication of a leak and it should be investigated.

There may be a clear reservoir or a dipstick for windshield washer fluid. Refer to the owner(cid:1)s manual for the location. If you live or travel in cold climates, below 32 degrees, you need to make sure that you use washer fluid with antifreeze. Windshield washer fluid Transmission Fluid. Refer to the owner(cid:1)s manual for the location of the transmission fluid. Some vehicles have a dipstick but many new vehicles do not have one. In some vehicles you have to go underneath the vehicle to check this fluid. If the fluid is low, then there is a leak and it should be investigated. The fluid should also be red. If it is black and/or has a burnt smell then there is a problem with the transmission. New transmission fluid, red in color Battery Fluid and Terminals: If the battery is clear then you can look at the level of the fluid. Most modern vehicles do not have clear batteries. Any corrosion or signs of leaks around the battery are indications of a problem. Corrosion can be a green or white powdery substance.

The chart will include such information as when to change the oil, rotate tires, replace the air filter, inspect fuel cap and lines, change other fluids (transmission fluid, etc.) and other maintenance issues. Your vehicle may have different maintenance requirements at 30,000 miles, 90,000 miles, 150,000 miles and at other intervals as indicated specifically in your owner(cid:1)s manual. Being familiar with the maintenance chart in your owner(cid:1)s manual can help you save money when taking your car to the mechanic for maintenance checks. Sometimes the repair shop will suggest additional services that aren(cid:1)t necessary. If you don(cid:1)t have the owner(cid:1)s manual for your car then you may be able to find one online by using Google or another search engine. Search the website for the make of the vehicle. You could also try your local library. Vehicle Fluids: Vehicle fluids include brake fluid, engine oil, coolant, power steering fluid, windshield washer fluid, transmission fluid and battery fluid. Fluid level information and the location of each fluid reservoir can be found in the owner(cid:1)s manual for your particular vehicle. (Any images in this chapter are illustrative of one example and your vehicle may look different). Brake Fluid: On most vehicles the reservoir for brake fluid is clear. You can check the fluid without removing the cap. There will be a marking on the reservoir that indicates minimum and maximum level. You(cid:1)ll want to make sure that the level is between those two marks. This fluid should never need to be topped off during maintenance. Low fluid is an indication of a problem.

Connect the hoses and close the drains. Fill the cooling system with new coolant to manufacturers specification and distilled water. Use a 50/50 mixture of coolant and distilled water or pre-mixed coolant. Flushing the cooling system will not correct an overheating concern. If your vehicle is overheating, (as indicated on the temperature gauge on the dash), it would need to be diagnosed and repaired. Any time you open the cooling system and put it back together you want to pressure test the cooling system to check for any leaks. You can use a pressure tester which can be rented from an auto parts store. It will come with instructions. Generally, it attaches to the radiator where the radiator cap goes, and you pump it by hand until the pressure on the gauge matches the pressure that is written on top of the radiator cap. Typically on a modern vehicle this pressure is between 13 - 16 psi. Let the vehicle sit with this pressure for 20 - 30 minutes. Then inspect the entire cooling system for any leaks and check the gauge for a change in pressure. If there is less pressure than before then there is probably a leak.

Image shows an inward toe of the front passenger tire. Measuring the distance between the front and back of the front tires as a pair and the rear tires as a pair. In this illustration, line a is shorter than line b, indicating an inward toe of one or both tires (both in this image). Lines c and d are equal in length, indicating a toe angle of zero. If a right wheel is turned inward while the left wheel is straight, or if both wheels are turned too far inward, or both are turned outward, etc., then there is an abnormal toe angle present and the wheels are not aligned. (Technically when you steer the vehicle and the front wheels turn to the left or right, they are deviating from the Y and Z planes, but they stay parallel to each other with only a slight variation to account for the fact that one wheel is on the outside and one is on the inside while turning). The caster angle is an angle which lies on the Y plane and deviates from the Z plane. (Imagine looking at the vehicle from the side). Most devices with steering capability do not have a caster angle of zero. When the deviation is towards the rear, the caster is considered positive. When the deviation is towards the front, the caster is considered negative. On motor vehicles the caster is usually positive, (the higher ball joint will be closer to the rear than the lower ball joint). This helps the vehicle to drive straight even when the steering wheel is hands-free. Since the view of the caster is blocked by the wheel on vehicles with four wheels, it is most easily visible on motorcycles and bicycles. Think of the two braces that come down on both sides of the front wheel. Notice how the handlebars are closer to the rear\n",

Excessive discharging of the battery without the engine running (i.e. listening to the radio, keeping the cab lights on or using any accessory with the engine off) can cause the battery to overheat, which leads to early battery failure and leakage of battery acid. If the battery fluid is low, only use distilled water to refill it. Never add acid to a battery. The presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. However, as a temporary fix, you can clean off the corrosion to get the car started. Start by rinsing off the corrosion with the garden hose. Then disconnect the terminals starting with the negative terminal first, then the positive terminal. Use a mixture of baking soda and water or battery terminal cleaner to rinse off the terminals and battery posts. You(cid:1)ll see the baking soda reacting with the corrosion to form fizz and bubbles. Use a wire brush or scraper (depending on the type of terminal) to clean the inside of the terminal and battery posts. Then rinse again with more water. Once the terminals and battery posts are clean, reattach the terminals starting with the positive terminal first, then the negative terminal. It is not sufficient just to clean off the corrosion.

If a rotor has any pits or grooves then it will have to be reconditioned or replaced. Check the thickness of all the brake pads. If there is any variation in the brake pad (or shoe) thickness between the driver side and passenger side, then there may be an adjustment problem, a defective caliper or other defective hardware. Usually the front brakes wear faster since the front brakes are responsible for about 80% of the stopping. There is no blanket measurement for brake pad thickness since the thickness of new pads can vary by make and model of the vehicle. A few millimeters could appear brand new in one car but be an indication for pad replacement in another. If the thickness of the pad is 20% of the original thickness or less, then the pads should be replaced. The original thickness can be found in the service manual for the vehicle.

A hydraulic device expands the shape of the shoes to press against the drum. This generates heat and stops the vehicle. Illustration of a drum brake Drum brake shoes (violet color) and linings. The master cylinder is a hydraulic cylinder that is used to apply force to the brake calipers and/or wheel cylinders. The wheel cylinders (used in drum brakes) and the brake calipers (used in disc brakes) are both (cid:1)hydraulic slave cylinders(cid:2). Anti-lock brakes have complex electrical and hydraulic components which are used to avoid skidding wheels in a panic stop or in a poor traction condition. The anti-lock brakes (ABS) use signals from each wheel speed sensor to determine if one wheel is stopping faster than any of the others. If this occurs, the ABS control module (a computer) will signal the ABS hydraulic control unit to isolate that wheel, release brake pressure, and then pulsates the brake pressure to maintain equal speeds of all four wheels. This helps avoid skidding and maintains maneuverability during a panic stop. How to Check the Brake System: The brake system is often checked by the mechanic during routine oil changes and maintenance. However, it can also be checked at home. Consult the service manual of the specific make and model about checking the brakes and finding the locations of each part of the brake system. Follow these steps to check the brake system: Start under the hood. Check the brake master cylinder for leaks. Check the level and condition of the brake fluid. Inspect all lines and the anti-lock brake module for leaks or loose, damaged connectors.

If your vehicle is overheating, (as indicated on the temperature gauge on the dash), it would need to be diagnosed and repaired. Any time you open the cooling system and put it back together you want to pressure test the cooling system to check for any leaks. You can use a pressure tester which can be rented from an auto parts store. It will come with instructions. Generally, it attaches to the radiator where the radiator cap goes, and you pump it by hand until the pressure on the gauge matches the pressure that is written on top of the radiator cap. Typically on a modern vehicle this pressure is between 13 - 16 psi. Let the vehicle sit with this pressure for 20 - 30 minutes.

            "Prior to 1985 most vehicles used a carburetor. A carburetor uses a venturi (narrowed passage within the carburetor) to draw fuel from a float bowl based strictly on the volume of air flowing through the carburetor. A carburetor is a primitive method of mixing air and fuel. It is far less efficient than modern fuel injection. That(cid:1)s why all modern cars today are built with fuel injection. How a Fuel Injection System Works: Fuel injection is a complex electrical circuit using multiple sensors as inputs to a PCM (powertrain control module, also called the computer). The PCM then interprets the inputs from these sensors and produces a PWM (pulse width modulated) signal. A PWM signal is a digital on/off signal. This translates into how much fuel is injected into the engine. The PCM then receives feedback signals from oxygen sensors. An oxygen sensor is a sensor that checks the air-fuel ratio by monitoring exhaust gas at or near the exhaust manifolds (review Chapter 5 if needed). Using this information, the PCM can adjust fuel trim accordingly to keep the engine running clean, long and efficient. This is one of the main reasons newer automobiles last so much longer, burn less fuel, and have cleaner emissions. Illustration of a fuel injector. Fuel Filter and Air Filter: There are two filters which protect the fuel system and engine: the fuel filter and the air filter. The fuel system is very sensitive to contamination and debris. A small amount of contamination can cause severe problems in any fuel system. Therefore, these filters are critical for protecting the fuel system and engine. A fuel filter (white) next to the air filter compartment (circular black part) When you fill your vehicle with fuel from a gas station, the fuel will have contaminants. Between the fuel tank and the engine the fuel passes through a sock filter which prevents large contaminants from passing through. Then the fuel will pass through the fuel filter which prevents small contaminants from passing. Anything that passes through the fuel\n",

Refer to the owner(cid:1)s manual to find the manufacturers recommendation for the mileage at which the fuel filter should be changed. An air filter protects the engine from dust and dirt entering the combustion chamber through the air intake system. Any dirt in the engine can cause engine wear and eventually lead to engine failure. Therefore, an air filter, like the fuel filter, is also a critical component in any internal combustion engine. The air filter is inspected with every oil change and it is changed as needed.

The battery is the power source of the whole vehicle. The alternator is a re-charging device which is used to maintain the charge of the battery. The ignition system is used to ignite the fuel at the correct time during the Otto cycle of events (review Chapter 5 for the Otto cycle of events). Alternator Ignition System (prior to 1975) The (cid:2)ignition(cid:3) in this lesson is not the same as the key ignition; it(cid:1)s about the ignition system that is used in the engine to ignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. Prior to 1975, the ignition system consisted of the ignition coil, capacitor, contact breaker, distributor and spark plugs. The ignition coil converts low voltage electricity into high voltage. The high voltage electricity is sent to the distributor through the rotor, then it transmits out the distributor cap through plug wires to the spark plugs. The contact breaker or contact points complete and interrupt the circuit to the ignition coil on the low voltage side. The capacitor absorbs a voltage spike when the points open to avoid burning the contacts of the points. In a\n"

To diagnose the issue, we'll need to check for any error codes stored in your vehicle's onboard computer (OBD-II). We can also look for signs of carbon buildup on the injector tips and check the fuel system pressure.\n\n**Instructions**:\n\n1. **Check Error Codes**: Use a code reader or scan tool to retrieve any error codes from your OBD-II system. If there are any codes related to the fuel injectors, we'll address them first.\n2. **Visual Inspection**: Look for signs of carbon buildup on the injector tips and around the base of the injectors. This can indicate a faulty or clogged injector.\n3. **Fuel Pressure Test**: Use a fuel pressure gauge to check the system pressure at idle and under load. If the pressure is too low, it could be an issue with the fuel pump, regulator, or fuel filter.\n4. **Fuel Injector Cleaning**: Before replacing the injectors, try cleaning them using a specialized cleaner and a high-pressure spray nozzle.\n\n**Tools Required**:\n\n* Code reader or scan tool (for retrieving error codes)\n* Fuel pressure gauge\n* High-pressure spray nozzle (for cleaning injector tips)\n\n**Parts Replacement**: If cleaning the injectors doesn't resolve the issue, we may need to replace them. Make sure to purchase fuel injectors that match your vehicle's specifications.\n\n**Safety Tips**:\n\n* Always follow proper safety procedures when working with electrical systems and high-pressure components.\n* Use protective gear, such as gloves and safety glasses, when handling chemicals or cleaning equipment.\n\nBefore proceeding, would you like to:\n\n1.

            "brake shoes are the friction material. A wheel cylinder applies pressure to a brake shoe with a friction lining. Think of a circle within a circle. A hydraulic device expands the shape of the shoes to press against the drum. This generates heat and stops the vehicle. Illustration of a drum brake Drum brake shoes (violet color) and linings. The master cylinder is a hydraulic cylinder that is used to apply force to the brake calipers and/or wheel cylinders. The wheel cylinders (used in drum brakes) and the brake calipers (used in disc brakes) are both (cid:1)hydraulic slave cylinders(cid:2). Anti-lock brakes have complex electrical and hydraulic components which are used to avoid skidding wheels in a panic stop or in a poor traction condition. The anti-lock brakes (ABS) use signals from each wheel speed sensor to determine if one wheel is stopping faster than any of the others. If this occurs, the ABS control module (a computer) will signal the ABS hydraulic control unit to isolate that wheel, release brake pressure, and then pulsates the brake pressure to maintain equal speeds of all four wheels. This helps avoid skidding and maintains maneuverability during a panic stop. How to Check the Brake System: The brake system is often checked by the mechanic during routine oil changes and maintenance. However, it can also be checked at home. Consult the service manual of the specific make and model about checking the brakes and finding the locations of each part of the brake system. Follow these steps to check the brake system: Start under the hood. Check the brake master cylinder for leaks. Check the level and condition of the brake fluid. Inspect all lines and the anti-lock brake module for leaks or loose, damaged connectors. Raise the vehicle and support it securely on a lift or jack stands (review Lesson 1 if needed) Remove all four wheels If the vehicle has drum brakes, then remove the drums. Inspect all brake lines and hoses for signs of leaking or cracking Inspect the caliper hardware and dust boots for damage\n",

This should be illuminated but it will not blink. Turn the right turn signal on. Check the right front and right rear of the vehicle for blinking lights. Be sure all applicable bulbs are illuminating. Check the cornering lamp if applicable. When the turn signal is on and the indicator is blinking fast or not blinking at all, these are indicators of a failed bulb. Brake lights require two people for inspection.

A steady light often indicates a problem with the ABS sensor, while a flashing light might suggest a malfunctioning wheel speed sensor.\n2. **Look for any error messages**: If your car has a built-in diagnostic system, check if there are any trouble codes stored. You can use an OBD-II scanner to retrieve these codes and identify potential issues.\n3. **Inspect the ABS sensors and wiring**:\n\t* Check the ABS sensors (usually located on the wheels or near the brake rotors) for any signs of damage, corrosion, or loose connections.\n\t* Inspect the wiring harness connected to the ABS sensors and ensure all connectors are secure.\n4. **Test the wheel speed sensors**: You can use a multimeter to measure the voltage at each sensor while driving slowly (around 10-20 mph). Compare the readings for any significant differences between wheels.\n5. **Check for proper wheel rotation**: Some modern vehicles have a feature that checks the ABS system's accuracy by applying a gentle pressure on the brake pedal while driving.

This image is animated at In a diesel engine there are no spark plugs. The fuel is ignited based on compression alone. The compression is higher on a diesel engine, which generates enough heat to cause the combustion. A hybrid vehicle uses an electric motor and battery for assisting propulsion along with the internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine generates electricity to recharge the batteries. Also, the batteries are recharged when braking to a stop. Engine Oil Sample of motor oil The purpose of engine oil is to form a film of lubrication between all moving parts of an internal combustion engine to reduce friction and wear. Choosing the right engine oil for your vehicle and changing the oil during regularly-scheduled maintenance intervals will keep the engine running smoothly over time. The recommended oil type and specification for your vehicle can be found in the owners manual. Another place to find it is on the oil fill cap. It will be based on the ambient temperature where you live. There are two engine oil codes that the owner(cid:1)s manual will specify, an API and an SAE. All oil has an API code which stands for American Petroleum Institute. Its a service rating for the quality, cleanliness, and types of detergents in the oil. The code will always be two letters. The SAE is the viscosity or thickness of the oil. Modern oil is multi-viscosity oil. The SAE may be something to the effect of 5W-30. The first number-letter combo (5W) indicates the viscosity or thickness of the oil when it is cold. The second number is the viscosity at the engine operating temperature. Before they had multi-viscosity oil there was only single-viscosity oil (such as SAE 30), which in cold weather was extremely thick. Trying to pour it into your engine would be like pouring honey, but more importantly it would be hard to pump the oil\n",

Probably the most important number for the common person to recognize is the recommended tire pressure on the vehicle manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications on the driver(cid:1)s door jamb sticker. (The tire manufacturer(cid:1)s specifications on the tire itself include the maximum pressure that the tire can have, yet the maximum pressure isn(cid:1)t necessarily the best pressure for the vehicle). How to Check the Tire Pressure In order to check tire pressure you(cid:1)ll need a tire pressure gauge. Gauges can be purchased at auto parts stores and service stations (sometimes a little as $1, but could be $3-$7). They(cid:1)re usually about the size of a large pen, but can come in other forms.

Fill the tire with air, recheck the pressure, then repeat as needed until the desired pressure is obtained. Replace the valve cap Tire pressure is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch) or KPA (Kilopascals) which are simply units of measurement for pressure. (Pressure is a force distributed over surface area) Checking the tire pressure Wheel Alignment Tires can wear rapidly if they are not aligned properly, or the vehicle can pull to one side while driving. There are three angle measurements that are used in tire alignment: camber, toe, and caster. Knowing these angles is necessary for any tire technician. In addition, knowing these angles can be helpful for anyone trying to communicate with tire technicians. In order to understand these angles one must consider the planes of the\n",

Excessive discharging of the battery without the engine running (i.e. listening to the radio, keeping the cab lights on or using any accessory with the engine off) can cause the battery to overheat, which leads to early battery failure and leakage of battery acid. If the battery fluid is low, only use distilled water to refill it. Never add acid to a battery. The presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. However, as a temporary fix, you can clean off the corrosion to get the car started. Start by rinsing off the corrosion with the garden hose. Then disconnect the terminals starting with the negative terminal first, then the positive terminal. Use a mixture of baking soda and water or battery terminal cleaner to rinse off the terminals and battery posts. You(cid:1)ll see the baking soda reacting with the corrosion to form fizz and bubbles. Use a wire brush or scraper (depending on the type of terminal) to clean the inside of the terminal and battery posts. Then rinse again with more water. Once the terminals and battery posts are clean, reattach the terminals starting with the positive terminal first, then the negative terminal. It is not sufficient just to clean off the corrosion. Again, the presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. Car battery Fuses Consult the owner(cid:1)s manual to locate the fuse boxes in your vehicle.

Since jump starting a failed battery with a charged battery involves creating an electrical circuit, it is important to follow the right steps to perform a jump start safely: Do your best to line up the vehicles so that the two batteries are close enough to connect jumper cables. Turn off the active vehicle Verify there is no odor (like sulfur) coming from either battery. If there is a sulfur odor do not attempt to jump start the vehicle. The battery could explode due to the gas that is released (hydrogen gas). The next steps involve connecting the cables. When connecting cables to the first vehicle, which is the dead vehicle, make sure the other ends of the cables are not touching each other. First connect the red cable to the positive (red) battery terminal on the dead battery or to the jump start locations specified in the owner(cid:1)s manual. Connect the black cable to the negative terminal of the dead battery or to the jump start locations specified in the owner(cid:1)s manual. Connect the positive (red) cable to the positive terminal of the working vehicle (or to the specified jump start location in the owner(cid:1)s manual of the working vehicle). Connect the negative (black) cable to the negative terminal of the working vehicle (or to the specified jump start location in the owner(cid:1)s manual of the working vehicle) or to anything metal. The metal must be bare or without any paint that would inhibit conduction of electricity. The engine block is sufficient.

That may seem like a lot of steps above to memorize, so here are some tricks to remember the process: first connect the Dead Red, Fred. This phrase will help you remember that when connecting the cables you(cid:1)ll start with the positive cable on the dead battery. The order is dead red, dead black, live red, live black. Then it(cid:1)s the reverse order to remove the cables after the dead battery is jumped: First remove the Jumped Black, Jack. Remove the jumped black, jumped red, then the previously live black, then the previously live red. Never attempt to jump start a diesel vehicle. Since a diesel engine battery requires much more power, attempting to jump start it could damage the running vehicle. Typically you can attempt to jump start a hybrid car, but if the high power battery is dead, the vehicle will not start. However, a hybrid can be used to jump start a regular gasoline vehicle. Chapter 9: The Drive Train The drive train (drivetrain or powertrain) is a series of parts that transfer energy from the combustion engine to the wheels. If needed, review Chapter 5 to recall how the internal combustion engine works to convert chemical energy to rotational energy.

Since your 2015 Toyota Camry's timing belt is likely due for replacement (most manufacturers recommend replacing it between 60,000 to 105,000 miles), we'll go through the steps to replace it.\n\n**Instructions**:\n\n1. **Warm up the engine**: Drive the car for a few minutes and then let it sit for at least 30 minutes to allow the components to expand.\n2. **Locate the timing belt**: The timing belt is located on the driver's side of the engine, near the water pump. It may be covered with a protective shroud or housing.\n3. **Remove the serpentine belt**: Take out the serpentine belt tensioner and remove the belt itself. This will give you access to the timing belt components.\n4. **Mark the timing belt position**: Use a marker or paint to mark the timing belt's original position on the pulleys.\n5. **Loosen the tensioner**: Loosen the timing belt tensioner bolt, but do not remove it yet.\n6. **Remove the timing belt covers**: Take out the bolts holding the timing belt covers in place and set them aside.\n7. **Remove the old timing belt**: With the covers removed, you should be able to see the old timing belt. Use a wrench or socket to loosen the tensioner bolt completely, then slide the timing belt off the pulleys.\n8. **Inspect and clean the pulleys**: Inspect the pulleys for any signs of wear or damage. Clean them with a wire brush if necessary.\n9. **Install the new timing belt**: Place the new timing belt on the pulleys, making sure it's properly seated.\n10. **Tighten the tensioner**: Tighten the tensioner bolt in a star pattern (tightening one lug, then moving to the next one, and so on).\n11. **Reinstall the timing belt covers**: Put back the timing belt covers and tighten the bolts firmly.\n\n**Tools Required**:\n\n* Socket wrench or ratchet\n* Torx driver (for serpentine belt tensioner)\n* Timing belt replacement kit (includes new timing belt, water pump gasket, etc.)\n* Marking tool (marker or paint)\n\n**Parts Replacement**: You'll need to replace the timing belt with a new one. Be sure to purchase a Toyota-approved timing belt kit for your specific vehicle.\n\n**Safety Tips**:\n\n* Make sure you have a good understanding of the process before attempting it.\n* Be cautious when working around the engine, as there are many moving parts and electrical components nearby.\n* Use proper safety equipment like gloves and protective eyewear.\n\nPlease confirm that you're comfortable with these steps.

This image is animated at In a diesel engine there are no spark plugs. The fuel is ignited based on compression alone. The compression is higher on a diesel engine, which generates enough heat to cause the combustion. A hybrid vehicle uses an electric motor and battery for assisting propulsion along with the internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine generates electricity to recharge the batteries. Also, the batteries are recharged when braking to a stop. Engine Oil Sample of motor oil The purpose of engine oil is to form a film of lubrication between all moving parts of an internal combustion engine to reduce friction and wear. Choosing the right engine oil for your vehicle and changing the oil during regularly-scheduled maintenance intervals will keep the engine running smoothly over time. The recommended oil type and specification for your vehicle can be found in the owners manual. Another place to find it is on the oil fill cap. It will be based on the ambient temperature where you live. There are two engine oil codes that the owner(cid:1)s manual will specify, an API and an SAE. All oil has an API code which stands for American Petroleum Institute. Its a service rating for the quality, cleanliness, and types of detergents in the oil. The code will always be two letters. The SAE is the viscosity or thickness of the oil. Modern oil is multi-viscosity oil. The SAE may be something to the effect of 5W-30. The first number-letter combo (5W) indicates the viscosity or thickness of the oil when it is cold. The second number is the viscosity at the engine operating temperature. Before they had multi-viscosity oil there was only single-viscosity oil (such as SAE 30), which in cold weather was extremely thick.

If it(cid:1)s still hot, then don(cid:1)t open it. Opening the radiator cap while the engine is still hot can shoot a six-foot geyser into the air and burn any skin it contacts. The best time to check the coolant is in the morning before the car is driven. Coolant. Notice the green color; coolant can actually be any color (pink, orange, transparent, red, etc.) A low coolant level indicates a possible leak which should be investigated. A very small amount of evaporation of coolant can occur over time. As a rule, if you need more than one quart of coolant, that indicates a problem. If the coolant is low then it needs to be replenished with the proper type of coolant and mixture. Consult the owner(cid:1)s manual for the proper type of coolant. The proper mixture is a 50/50 ratio of coolant and distilled water. It is important to use distilled water because the impurities in\n",

Glowplug Indicator Light: This light is only seen in vehicles with diesel engines. The glow plug is a device that is used to help get the diesel engine started. High Beam Indicator or Brights. Usually blue, but can be red on older vehicles. This indicates that your brights are on. Low Coolant Level Light: Red, Orange or yellow light. This light indicates that the engine coolant level is low, which could be due to a leak. It is still safe to drive as long as the engine temperature light is not on. In some vehicles the first symbol above, the thermometer symbol, can also be a temperature light. (Remember from Chapter 2 that the coolant level should not be checked while the engine is hot). Some vehicles can have a blue thermometer symbol. Consult the owner(cid:1)s manual for its description. Low Fuel Light: Yellow or Orange. This light indicates that fuel is low. It could also be a simple round light that illuminates when the fuel gauge is nearing empty. Low Oil Level Light: Yellow or Orange. The oil level is low. Refill the oil as soon as possible and bring the vehicle to a shop to see why it was low. Low Oil Pressure or Engine Oil Pressure Light: Red light (immediately pull over safely). Once you pull over you could check your oil level and add oil if it(cid:1)s low. If the light continues illuminated then you should have your vehicle towed to a facility. Catastrophic engine failure will occur if the oil pressure is low. Repairs for these damages can be very expensive. Parking Brake Light: Red light. The parking brake is engaged or not fully released. Release it completely before driving. Service Vehicle Soon: Yellow light. This light may be used in conjunction with other lights. Depending on which other lights are illuminated, there may be a problem with the anti-lock brakes (ABS), brake hydraulic system, traction control system (TCS), or the electronic suspension system.

Let's explore possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Improper Oil Filter Installation**: If you didn't follow the correct procedure for installing the new oil filter, it might be causing a restriction in oil flow or a leak.\n2. **Over-Tightening of Oil Drain Plug**: If the plug was over-torqued, it could cause excessive wear on the threads and lead to engine damage.\n3. **Cross-Contamination with Old Oil**: If you didn't properly drain the old oil and flush the system, there might be a small amount of residual oil causing issues.\n\n**Instructions**:\n\n1. **Check the Oil Filter**: Verify that it's installed correctly and not leaking. Make sure to torque it to the specified value.\n2. **Inspect the Oil Drain Plug**: Check if it was over-torqued or if there are any signs of damage. If necessary, retighten it carefully.\n3. **Perform a Compression Test**: This will help you determine if the issue is related to a leaky head gasket, valves, or piston rings.\n\n**Tools Required**:\n\n* Multimeter (for testing electrical connections)\n* Socket set (for checking torque values)\n* Compression test kit\n\n**Parts Replacement**: If the problem persists after inspecting and addressing potential issues, it's possible that you'll need to replace one of the following components:\n\t+ Oil filter\n\t+ Oil drain plug\n\t+ Head gasket\n\t+ Valves or piston rings (rare but possible)\n\n**Safety Tips**:\n\n* Be cautious when working with tools and machinery to avoid injury.\n* Ensure you follow proper procedures for handling oil and engine parts.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like more guidance on any of these steps or if you have further questions.\n",
